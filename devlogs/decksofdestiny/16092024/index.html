                    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">It's been an exciting first week of development! While I'm still in the very early stages, I wanted to share a quick update—if only to look back on it in a few weeks and see how far I've come.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">This week started with an idea, and now I’m working on small pieces of the game. I also made a significant switch, moving from GameMaker to Unity, which has been a great learning experience so far. There’s still a long road ahead, but I’m proud of the progress I’ve made.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">At this point, I can select, draw, and 'play' cards in the game. I say ‘play’ loosely, as for now, all that happens is the card leaves your hand. But hey, it's something!</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 5px;">Next week, my main goal is to make sure that hands are valid before being played and have a more functional play mechanic.</p>
