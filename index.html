                <p>2025 is here, a new year with lots of time to fill in.</p>
                <p>This year, I’ve set myself the goal of finally finishing and releasing one of the projects I’ve thought about for some time.</p>
                <p>
                    I’ve narrowed it down to two projects:
                    <ul>
                        <li>MoneyManager (Windows app)</li>
                        <li>The Oracle (Text-base simulation)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>MoneyManager</b><br>
                    This app is all about helping people manage their finances better. It lets you categorize transactions and set up realistic monthly budgets. But it doesn’t stop there—it can predict your future expenses and income, showing you if your budgets will hold up or if you’re slipping into expensive habits. The idea is to give people a clear picture of their financial health, not just in the moment but in the months ahead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The Oracle</b><br>
                    This is a text-based adventure rooted in Greek mythology. You play as the Pythia, the priestess of Apollo, delivering prophecies to those who come seeking guidance. The game starts in Apollo’s temple, where he asks you how you’ll share his divine messages—a choice that will have consequences later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the Pythia, your choices matter:
                    <ul>
                        <li>How you deliver prophecies affects how much certain gods favor you.</li>
                        <li>Your words influence the morale of the people. Push them too far, and they might turn on you.</li>
                        <li>If your favor with the gods or the people gets too low, you’ll face assassination attempts, divine wrath, or worse.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What has happened in January already?:</b>
                    <p>Since the start of this year mainly worked on MoneyManager. Importing data and categorizing it works for the most part, and I’m able to filter the data for a more specific view.</p>
                    <p>I’ve also worked on screens to visualize the budget and actual expenses / income of said categories. I’m very happy how this all looks.</p>
                    <p>Less has been done for the game. I contacted my best friend to see if he’s interested in helping and writing for it, and worked on the main dialog system.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hopefully I’ve interested you enough to follow me on this journey.<br>
                    I’ll be back with more very soon.
                </p>
