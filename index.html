                <p>With 2025 in full swing, I’ve set myself a major goal: to finally finish and release two of the passion projects I’ve been thinking about for ages.</p>
                <p>
                    I’ve narrowed it down to two projects:
                    <ul>
                        <li>MoneyManager (Windows app)</li>
                        <li>The Oracle (Text-based simulation)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>MoneyManager</b><br>
                    MoneyManager is all about helping people take control of their finances. It goes beyond the basics of categorizing transactions and setting monthly budgets. The app predicts future expenses and income, giving users insights into whether their financial habits are sustainable—or if trouble’s brewing on the horizon. The goal is to provide a comprehensive view of financial health, not just for today but for the months ahead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The Oracle</b><br>
                    This narrative-driven game is steeped in Greek mythology. You play as the Pythia, the priestess of Apollo, tasked with delivering divine prophecies. The game kicks off in Apollo’s temple, where your choices on how to share his messages set the tone for your journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some key features:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your prophecies shape how much favor you gain (or lose) with the gods.</li>
                        <li>The people react to your words—push them too far, and they may rebel.</li>
                        <li>Low favor with the gods or the people can lead to assassination attempts, divine wrath, or worse.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Every decision matters, and the world reacts to your actions in significant ways.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>January Progress:</b>
                    <p>
                        Since the start of the year, I’ve mainly focused on MoneyManager, and it’s shaping up well. Here’s what’s been accomplished so far:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Importing and Categorizing Data: The core functionality for importing transaction data and categorizing it is up and running smoothly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Filtering and Visualization: I’ve built screens to filter data for specific views, and I’m thrilled with how the budget and actual expenses/income visualizations are turning out.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, progress on The Oracle has been slower, but the groundwork has been laid:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I reached out to my best friend, who might help with writing the story and dialogue.</li>
                            <li>I’ve also begun developing the main dialog system, which will be central to the gameplay experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m excited to see where this journey leads and which project will ultimately take the spotlight. For now, I’ll keep pushing forward. Stay tuned for updates—I’ll have more to share soon!
