                <p>The import button is now disabled after clicking it, and I added a progressbar which shows progress 😊</p>

                <p>Had a productive day working on data visualization! 🎨 I’m now able to summarize key values in a much clearer way, and I started adding data filters to improve the user experience. 💡</p>

                <ul>
                    <strong>🔧 Things I noticed to work on:</strong>
                    <li>🤦‍♂️ Forgot to disable the import button while data is still being processed. Classic rookie move!</li>
                    <li>🚧 A loading bar that shows progress (e.g., rows being imported vs. already done) would be super helpful. I can already imagine how much smoother this will make the process.</li>
                </ul>

                Onward to more improvements! 🚀

                <p>Sooo… a new year, and this year I wanna actually ‘finish’ a game or app. I need to come back to what ‘finishing’ this game means, but I want to work on it at least a few hours every week (and hopefully close to every day).</p>

                <p>There’s two projects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Money Manager</strong></li>
                    <p>The name really says everything. Import bank data -> put them into categories -> manage budgets -> let AI check if this budget is fine or not.</p>
                    <p>Last year I worked on importing things and the basic functionality for categories. Today I actually made the first real steps for AI.</p>
                    <li><strong>Your World</strong></li>
                    <p>I love city builders, so I want to make my own 😊. The first steps were already there, but I put it away and started over. Now, the basic functionalities for the camera are in place. I need to build things like the turn-based system, buildings, and more. At some point, I want to create systems like sickness that could kill off your population, complete with their own screens to track sickness rates.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>Today, I worked on the AI for Money Manager. It actually seems to work pretty well. It’s a very simple model that predicts the next month based on all the data in the database at that point. I need to think about what kind of models the app needs. It might be interesting to have different models for short-term and long-term predictions.</p>
                <p>I also made this site! So YIPPEE!</p>
