                            <p>August 20th 2025, the start of my journey.</p>

                            <p>I've been doing some deep thinking about what I want to achieve on this journey. My goal
                                is clear but challenging: to become a mentally stable person who can manage fears and
                                anxieties, someone who handles situations without letting fear control her life.</p>

                            <p>Why does this matter so much to me? I need to be in control of my life and emotions to
                                build lasting relationships. I realize I've been pushing people away by oversharing my
                                intense emotions and fears. I get paranoid at the slightest hint something might be
                                happening, and this costs me energy while hurting their trust in me.</p>

                            <p>I struggle with separation anxiety. It makes me want to know EVERYTHING that's going on
                                around me, which spawns so many fears in my head. I'm hurting people with the things I
                                do, share, and think. But I want a future, and I can get it. By doing just 1% better
                                each day.</p>

                            <p>Today I learned emotions trigger behavior, which triggers more emotions. It's a cycle I
                                need to break. I'm going to counter this with a simple exercise: whenever I feel a
                                strong emotion, I'm going to write it down along with how it makes me want to react.
                                Take a deep breath, then let it go.</p>

                            <p>I also tried the mountain exercise to prepare myself for handling change. And I'm
                                practicing noticing bad thoughts and letting them go instead of feeding them. It's not
                                easy, but it's necessary.</p>

                            <p>The reminder that keeps me going: I can take care of myself in small ways.<br>This
                                journey doesn't require perfection, just progress, one small step at a time.</p>
